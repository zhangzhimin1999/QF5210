# cooperation rules 
to start a effecient cooperation , we use git to management verssion and note the contributions . 
## before codeing :
before coding , most work can be done independently , like finding data , modeling , finding refs and so on , every one can do jobs he thinks necessary and then upload his result in some files.

but for the ease during organizing PPTs and writting the report , plz add the work you do into the readme.md "# log"in every filedor.

it's better to add info contains what files have been changed by this work and an abstract about this work.

for example:

```
# log
## LI YUSU:
add the cooperation rules and examples to file "cooperation.md"
## Mr.M:
this is just an example
```

## during coding
this is the progress cooperation strength strongest , every one's work depends on eachother . so the rules here are extremly important:
### sample file :
before you coding yourself , please check your upstream and down stream to see if any of them has already offered a sample file of input/output . if they have , please use them as your coding input/output , else please offer your sample file .

#### input
```
Condition	Group	Pre1	Pre2	Pre3	Pre4	Learning	Gender
Low	A	0.77	0.91	0.24	0.72	0.9	M
Low	A	0.82	0.91	0.62	0.9	0.87	F
Low	A	0.81	0.7	0.43	0.46	0.9	F

……
```

#### output 
```
e,t
1,1
1,2
```

### test script :
```bash
(cfa) F:\学习资料\研一上\dsa\project>Rscript toy_model.R
Warning message:
Error in resduals(fit1) : 没有"resduals"这个函数

(cfa) F:\学习资料\研一上\dsa\project>
```
where input file is a.csv output is b.csv
